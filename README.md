# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms (DSA) in Python. It is part of my course project to study and practice key concepts in computer science.

## Data Structures Implemented:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary, Binary Search Tree)
- Graphs
- Heaps

## Algorithms Implemented:
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS)
- Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Fibonacci)
